			<h2> Who is Tadao Ando?</h2>
			<p>
				Tadao Ando is a Japanese architect who was born in 1941 in Osaka, Japan. Ando learned about architecture on his own. During his 20s, Ando travelled around the Western hemisphere to develop an understanding and a feel of Western architecture. He used his understanding of modern Western architecture to create his signature style and develop his design philosophy. He combined modern Western architecture techniques with old school Japanese architecture techniques to create a unique style of design. The most evident part of Ando's philosophy is the way he incorporates nature into his works. Ando has a great tendency of designing his works to be illuminated by natural lighting from the environment as opposed to artificial light sources. Ando's use of light is very unique to him which makes it easy to tell his work apart from other's. Ando also has a tendency of designing his buildings to fit right into their environment and uses the natural environment as a guide for the aesthetics of his work. Ando has designed buildings all over the world.
