			<h2> Chapel On the Water</h2>
			<p>
				The Chapel On the Water is a church that was designed by Tadao Ando in 1988 in the village of Shimukappu on the Japanese island of Hokkaido. This project is quite literally what its name implies: a church on water. This work exemplifies Ando's design philosophy of combining nature with his works. There is an interior space of the church where people are allowed to dwell in, but the main feature of the church is the framed opening of a cross in the middle of water which is surrounded by the natural environment of grass and trees. The view of the cross stands out because Ando framed it in a way where the space inside the church feels very tight and enclosed which contrasts with the openness and brightness of the cross. The framing of the cross in the middle of the green environment brings a unique emphasis to the religious symbol. This is another example of a work by Ando where there is a dynamic dimension of lighting due to the main light source of the work being the natural light as opposed to artificial lighting.
