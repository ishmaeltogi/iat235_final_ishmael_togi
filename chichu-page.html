			<h2> Chichu Art Museum</h2>
			<p>
				The Chichu Art Museum is a museum that Tadao Ando designed in 2004 on the island of Naoshima in Japan. This is one of Ando's many works that showcases his ability to combine nature with his architecture. Ando is no stranger to designing buildings to fit right into their surroundings. The Chichu Art Museum is unique because a majority of the building is underground. Ando did this to avoid causing too much change to the natural environment surrounding the building. When looked at from the sky, the shape structure of the exterior of the building blends right into the island that Ando was designing on. The shapes of the exterior of the museum poking out of the ground do a good job of complimenting the nature around them. The museum being built underground also allows for many of the works inside to be illuminated by the natural skylight which adds a dynamic dimension of lighting to the art inside of the museum.
