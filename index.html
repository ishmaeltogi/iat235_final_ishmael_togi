			<p>Welcome to the Ando Experience: A limited time exhibition coming to the Vancouver Art Museum in 2023. We at the Vancouver Art Museum are proud to announce this limited time exhibit that is inspired by architect Tadao Ando. This exhibition was put together by a group of architecture students who did an amazing job of replicating some of Ando's more fascinating works. The exhibit will run from Friday, December 30, 2023 through Sunday, January 29, 2023.   </p>
